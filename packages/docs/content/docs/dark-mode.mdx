description: Learn about Lector's dark mode implementation using CSS filters and future plans
---

## Current Approach

Lector implements dark mode support through custom CSS filters since PDF.js currently doesn't provide native dark mode support. This approach allows us to maintain compatibility while providing a good dark mode experience for users.

## Implementation Details

We use CSS filters to invert colors and adjust them for better readability in dark mode. This solution, while not perfect, provides a reasonable dark mode experience without requiring modifications to PDF.js itself.

```tsx
import { Root, Pages, Page, CanvasLayer } from "@anaralabs/lector";

function PDFViewer() {
  return (
    <Root fileUrl='/sample.pdf'>
      <Pages className='dark:invert-[94%] dark:hue-rotate-180 dark:brightness-[80%] dark:contrast-[228%]'>
        <Page>
          <CanvasLayer />
        </Page>
      </Pages>
    </Root>
  );
}
```

## Current Limitations

The CSS filter approach has some limitations:

1. Color accuracy might not be perfect for all PDF documents
2. Some PDFs with complex color schemes might not render optimally
3. Performance impact on larger documents

## Future Plans

We are actively monitoring the PDF.js development regarding native dark mode support. As referenced in [PDF.js Issue #2071](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/issues/2071), there are currently no plans to implement this feature in PDF.js itself.

### Forking PDF.js

**Forking PDF.js**: We might fork PDF.js in the future to implement proper dark mode support directly in the rendering pipeline.
